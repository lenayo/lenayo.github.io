Nestled among trees along a busy Independence, Mo., thoroughfare, Hidden Valley Animal Hospital doesn't mirror Dr. Falk's rural roots. But the way he built and runs the hospital reflects his upbringing. Dr. Falk earned distinction among the 1998 Veterinary Economics Hospital Design Competition winners as the only doctor who handledeverything himself, from design to construction supervision. "My costs were lower, but my hair may be grayer," he says, laughing. The hard work paid off-judges praised the practice's elevations and workspaces.</p><p><font size="3"><b>Meticulous planning</b></font></p>Dr. Falk worked his way up the veterinary ladder for 17 years, eventually becoming a partner in a three-doctor practice. Still, he yearned to break out on his own. For years, he eyed the 78,000-square-foot lot on a main north-south route in Independence, eastern Kansas City, Mo., suburb. He hoped to subdivide the property, but the owners refused. Determined, Dr. Falk devised a creative financing arrangement, using an IRA to buy the site. "I researched land financing," says the 1974 Kansas State University graduate. "My IRA purchased the site, then I sold myself 27,000 square feet for the hospital." <br><br>Dr. Falk plans to sell the remaining land for commercial development.While zoning proceeded smoothly, financing surprises complicated the project. Dr. Falk planned to tap the Small Business Administration (SBA), which usually requires 10 percent down. But without established income as a sole proprietor, he had to put 30 percent down. "I could've moved into a leasehold to establish my business, but I'd waited almost 20 years to start a practice. I didn't want to wait anymore," he says. "It didn't seem fair, but I had to play by the SBA's rules." So he mortgaged his house to raise the extra money. <br><br>To design and build his facility, Dr. Falk tapped his high school and college construction experience. He studied 20 years of Veterinary Economics' hospital design winners. "I put ideas in a folder and waited for the day I could incorporate them into my own hospital," he says. With the site set, Dr. Falk put his plans on paper. To account for the lot's 45-degree north-south slope, he designed two facilities, one atop the other. The main level houses the 3,200-square-foot hospital. Grooming and boarding are on the lower level, which features a separate parking lot. "It's like a walk-out basement," he explains.<br><br>The multilevel facility proved an economical solution at $78 a square foot. After Dr. Falk drew sketches, architect and family friend Todd Bodenstab drafted plans for permits and financing. Bodenstab also served as builder while Dr. Falk acted as general contractor. During construction, Dr. Falk worked nights and weekends at an emergency clinic, which let him spend days on-site. But the project wasn't a two-man show.<br><br>Dr. Falk's four sons helped with cleanup and painting. "We had our own crew-Falk and Sons actually built the practice," Dr. Falk says. When winter storms blanketed the facility, Dr. Falk and his sons shoveled a path for workers. Even nowwhen the boys need money for college, Dr. Falk puts them to work walking dogs and cleaning cages. Dr. Falk's wife, Koko, staffed the reception desk at first. "Building this facility has been good for ourfamily," he says. "Our sons watched my wife and me work together, and they have a part-time job whenever they need it. Although none of my sons is currently studying veterinary medicine, they've learned hard work's value."<br><br>Bad weather plagued the project, further testing Dr. Falk's patience-and bank account. What began as a four-month project lasted a year thanks to 1993's spring and summer floods. Trucks couldn't enter the waterlogged site. "During nice weather, subcontractors worked on bigger projects, so I had to constantly prod them to complete ours, Dr. Falk says. Although low interest rates helped ease costs, he didn't budget for delays.<br><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/popup/hosp_article/reception_image.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="145"><br><font color="336666" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Hospital's Spacious reception area</font></td><td><img src="images/popup/hosp_article/waiting_image.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="145"><br><font color="336666" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Hospital's dog waiting area.</font></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" width="500"><font color="336666" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br><p><font size="3"><b>A custom-made image</b></font></p>From the moment clients enter the parking lot, it's clear Hidden Valley Animal Hospital is unique. The landscaping and stone-and-redwood sign reflect the hospital's exterior materials and blend with woodedsurroundings. "We saw a similar sign in a residential subdivision and wanted the same look," says Koko Falk. "We didn't want neon or aluminum. We wanted the sign to reinforce the way we run the practice-like a family. Wood and stone on the sign and hospital send the right message." <br><br>Extensive landscaping gives the new structure a permanent image. Dr.Falk and his sons transplanted mature trees from the lot's southside to add shade and atmosphere to the hospital. The practice radiates family charm-even the fragrant honeysuckle came from the family's garden. In the vestibule, glass-encased professional animal portraits greet clients. "We conduct two drawings a month for photo portraits of clients' pets," says Dr. Falk. "They're a big hit."<br><br>The spacious reception area features skylights, which bathe plants in sunlight. Separate dog and cat waiting areas keep noise low, and oak chairs let Dr. Falk vary the seating arrangement. A large wreathopposite the reception desk adds a warm touch. Dark plaid wallpaper prevents the open area from appearing vacuous. To preserve space, Dr. Falk installed custom food displays for various bag sizes. "Cubbyholeslet us stock a lot of food without taking up too much space," he says Each waiting area contains a pet-specific display.<br><br>Custom details continue in exam rooms, where tables were built to Dr.Falk's height specifications. Corian countertops, purchased from a salvage yard, are impervious to stains, and scratches can be sanded away. Narrow openings at the exam tables' far ends lead to hidden trash cans. "I hated having to scoop up nail clippings and carry them to the trash," says Dr. Falk. "Now I just whisk them into the trash."Tables feature needle drops as well.<br><br>Another unique exam feature: Two adjacent dog rooms share aninstrument pass-through. All three exam rooms are equipped with a refrigerator for drugs and vaccines as well as a video monitor. Waiting clients watch pet-health videos. But nearly $30,000 in custom cabinets makes Dr. Falk more efficient: "I'm trying to remain in solo practice, and such little features as hidden trash cans and pass-throughs eliminate steps. I can gross more alone than I did in a three-doctor practice becausethe efficient floor plan lets me see more patients."<br><br>As much as Dr. Falk enjoys efficiency, clients appreciate the quiet, odor-free environment.  The hospital is insulated with blown-in cellulose, or recycled newspaper. Insulation between the kennel's roof and dropped ceiling helps control boarding noise. And stainless-steelraised runs with a central trough make cleanup with a power sprayer easy. </font><br><br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="images/popup/hosp_article/last_para.gif" alt="" width="500" height="13"></td></tr></table><br></body></html>
