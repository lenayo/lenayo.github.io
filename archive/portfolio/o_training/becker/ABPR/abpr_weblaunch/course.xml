Most any CPA candidate who ever sat in a Becker classroom between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s would recognize that phrase. It's how Newt Becker began the audio-taped lectures that were the cornerstone of Becker CPA Review for two-thirds of its 50 year history and an appropriate start to the Becker story.  Like many successful companies, Becker began small in size but inspired by a great idea. The year was 1957. One man stood in front of eight of his colleagues in the Cleveland offices of their employer, Price Waterhouse. Their common goal was success on the CPA exam. Their pathway to that goal was a previously untested approach, the brainchild of a man who had studied and sometimes struggled, mostly on his own, to pass the exam just a few years earlier.Take some time and interact with the timeline for Becker's history. Learn about Newt's innovative beginnings and where Becker plans to be in the future.

Before he founded Becker CPA Review he worked for Price Waterhouse. After working for three years, he decided to get his CPA designation and found that there were few good resources to prepare for the exam. This began his quest to design a course that covered type of questions asked on the CPA exam, their frequency, sequence, and areas of emphasis. So he designed the course based on the foundational principles still used today: understand, apply, review and practice.				1960 - Becker CPA Review BeginningsBecker CPA Review is the leading training firm preparing students to take the nationally administered and centrally graded Certified Public Accounting (CPA) exam.  The company also offers Certified Management Accountant (CMA) review courses.1964 - Adoption of TechnologyNewt writes and teaches the course himself until 1964, then, in an effort to grow the company, he adds personally trained faculty members and began sending out cassette tapes and transparencies to interested candidates. 1996 - DeVry Acquires Becker CPA ReviewDeVry acquires Becker CPA Review in 1996 because of the high quality of its educational programs and its other similarities to DeVry Institute and Keller Graduate School of Management.  Becker had an outstanding reputation and its international network fit well with DeVry's long-term growth strategy. Through DeVry's acquisition of Becker a strong foundation for growth has allowed for the ability to branch into new areas including making leading edge technological progress.  1997+ - Advances in TechnologyIn June 1997, the first Becker CPA Review course on CD, complete with 128 hours of multimedia content, was introduced. In 1998, multimedia was integrated into the live classroom instruction and blended learning, the combination of classroom participation and online study was introduced in 2001. 1998+ - M&A StrategyBetween 1998 and 2004, Becker implements a successful growth strategy focusing on mergers and acquisitions that include the following companies:•	Gross-Monette – 1998•	Conviser-Duffy – 1999•	Fox Gearty - 1999•	LHR - 1999•	Person Wolinsky – 2003With these acquisitions, came some of the best teaching talent in the CPA exam review profession.  Becker was able to capably developscale, increase revenue, and lower costs by consolidating operations.1999 - Becker-ConviserIn 1999, Conviser-Duffy is comparable in size to Becker yet they focus on the college market while Becker concentrates  on accounting professionals. They have brand recognition on the campuses. The merger was well received by all and the decision was made to call the new company Becker-Conviser.2001 - Stalla Review for the CFA ExamsIn 2001, Becker acquires Stalla CFA Review, a provider of preparation programs for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Examinations. The CFA designation is the most respected and valued credential in the global finance community, and has become a virtual pre-requisite for advancement in the field of financial analysis. Stalla was founded in 1978 by Robert J. Stalla, Ph.D., CFA, who pioneered the idea of providing intensive reviews for the CFA Exams. 2001 - Becker Professional Review (BPR)With the acquisition of Stalla, DeVry forms Becker Professional Review as the parent for both Becker and Stalla.2002 - Acquisitions + Sarbanes Oxley = GrowthWhen congress passes The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the demand for accountants, and CPAs in particular, skyrockets. The number of accounting grads starts growing, which added even more momentum to Becker's growth strategy. Soon the company is on the road to over tripling its worth at the time of the acquisitions.2005 - BPR Enters CPE BusinessBecker Professional Review enters the continuing professional education (CPE) business in 2005 through the acquisition of Gearty CPE, a provider of high quality continuing professional education programs and seminars in accounting and finance. ]]></param>				<param name="forward01.swf_cc"><![CDATA[Click Forward to continue...]]></param>			</page>												<page id="3" title="Becker's division, brands and products Overview">				<param name="mediaContent">blank.swf|abpr0200201v.swf|forward01.swf</param>				<param name="mediaXPos">0|111|115</param>				<param name="mediaYPos">0|131|131</param>				<param name="mediaWidth">550|402|709</param>				<param name="mediaHeight">400|302|319</param>				<param name="useMediaController">false|true|false</param>				<param name="frameRate">30^30^30</param>				<param name="bgContent">abpr0200201f.swf</param>				<!-- cc text -->				<param name="abpr0200201v.swf_cc"><![CDATA[As you can tell from Becker's rich history, there have been many milestones with several organizational changes and growth initiatives.  Let's break it down so it's manageable and clear. Becker Professional Review (which may be referred to as BPR) is an independent operating division of DeVry, our parent company.  BPR has two specific brands - Becker and Stalla.  Each brand has its own products and has its own focus.  Becker focuses on accounting and offers products such as Becker CPA Review courses.   Stalla focuses on finance and offers products such as review for the CFA exams. We're going to learn more about our products and services in another course.  For now, it will be helpful to remember the high-level differences between our division, our brands and our products.]]></param>								<param name="forward01.swf_cc"><![CDATA[Click Forward to continue...]]></param>			</page>										<page id="4" title="Becker's division, brands and products Overview">				<param name="mediaContent">blank.swf|abpr0200301v.swf|forward01.swf</param>				<param name="mediaXPos">0|111|115</param>				<param name="mediaYPos">0|131|131</param>				<param name="mediaWidth">550|402|709</param>				<param name="mediaHeight">400|302|319</param>				<param name="useMediaController">false|true|false</param>				<param name="frameRate">30^30^30</param>				<param name="bgContent">abpr0200301f.swf</param>				<!-- cc text -->				<param name="abpr0200301v.swf_cc"><![CDATA[Becker's course has changed and advanced over the years.
